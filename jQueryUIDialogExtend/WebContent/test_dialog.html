							does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun, evoke
							such an eyeless statue in the soul?</p>
						<p>Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned
							warriors and kings (which will not wholly account for it) that
							makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly on the
							imagination of an untravelled American, than those other storied
							structures, its neighbors&mdash;the Byward Tower, or even the
							Bloody? And those sublimer towers, the White Mountains of New
							Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic
							ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name, while
							the thought of Virginia's Blue Ridge is full of a soft, dewy,
							distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and
							longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a
							spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls
							us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the
							waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or,
							to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to
							the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,
							does "the tall pale man" of the Hartz forests, whose changeless
							pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the
							groves&mdash;why is this phantom more terrible than all the
							whooping imps of the Blocksburg?</p>

				<h2>Whitsuntide marshal</h2>
				<p>Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her
					cathedral-toppling earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic
					seas; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the
					sight of her wide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones,
					and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and
					her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as
					a tossed pack of cards;&mdash;it is not these things alone which
					make tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city thou can'st see.
					For Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher horror in
					this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness keeps her
					ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete
					decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an
					apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.</p>
				<h3>Lima has taken the white veil</h3>
				<p>I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of
					whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating
					the terror of objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative
					mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness
					to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon,
					especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to
					muteness or universality. What I mean by these two statements may
					perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples.</p>

				<p>First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign
					lands, if by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to
					vigilance, and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his
					faculties; but under precisely similar circumstances, let him be
					called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight
					sea of milky whiteness&mdash;as if from encircling headlands shoals
					of combed white bears were swimming round him, then he feels a
					silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened
					waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures
					him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go down; he
					never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is the
					mariner who will tell thee, "Sir, it was not so much the fear of
					striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that
					so stirred me?"</p>
				<h3>white bears were</h3>
				<a class="btn primary openLightbox" href="#">Open lightbox</a>
				<p>Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of
					the snowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in
					the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at
					such vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness
					it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the
					same is it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative
					indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow,
					no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness.
					Not so the sailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas;
					where at times, by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers
					of frost and air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of
					rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a
					boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments
					and splintered crosses.</p>
